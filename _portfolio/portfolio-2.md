## Three Common Themes
- Visual and Audio Media: This media theme is based on visual information with some audio aided.([reference 1](http://people.tamu.edu/~asees/media.html), [reference 2](https://people.tamu.edu/~kieranbeirne01/index.html), [reference 4](https://brineypw.wixsite.com/piercebriney), [reference 7](https://sites.google.com/view/tommygarriga/home))
<br>
- Audio Media, like music: This theme is purely audio that includes songs, broadcast and some others. ([reference 1](http://people.tamu.edu/~asees/media.html), [reference 5](https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/445site-briannabrown/home), [reference 10](https://manik-taneja.github.io/), [reference 11](https://sinsarwathi.wixsite.com/mysite))
<br>
- Text Media: This theme is based on text and it is the probably oldest and most professional type of media. ([reference 3](https://sites.google.com/view/csce445-cnm-tajbounds/home), [reference 4](https://brineypw.wixsite.com/piercebriney), [reference 6](https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/fchen/home), [reference 10](https://manik-taneja.github.io/))
<br>
- Social Media: This theme is developed with the advances in information technology and because of its distinct attributes, I make it an independent media theme.

## How would I revise and add my media categorization?
While there are many categorization of media, but I only use some of them. For example, I hardly use text-based media, so I did not consider them in my original post. To revise it, I would consider media more as its transmission object, like audio, video or text, instead of categorizing them as the devices I have those medias. I mostly have visual medias in my list, and I would like to add a second list as audio media and in this list I would list my favorite songs and also some broadcast stations that I actually use sometimes.
